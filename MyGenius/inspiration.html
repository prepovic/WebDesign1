            <tr>
                <td>This man helped me understand how to use <br> DSLR camera and ajust all the setting just right, one could argue he started my love of photography</td>
                <td>I really like the style of his work and really hope to take photos like him some day. One of his best aspects is his use of light and monocoloristic photography</td>
                <td>I like how this photographer takes photos in a way that really is not possible to see from the grond and thus allows people to gain a whole new perspective on the world</td>
            </tr>

    </table>
    <p>I recommend finding someone who you want your work to be like so you don't get lost in the sea of photo styles</p>
